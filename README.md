## Generator Script for Organizing Solutions

To make life easier, I wrote a
[shell script](https://github.com/dunleavyjack/Leetcode-Progress/blob/main/add_question.sh)
that generates everything I need when I add a new solution. It creates:

- A folder for the problem
- A `.ts` file for the code
- A `.md` file for solution explanations and tips for future me

The command is:

```shell
npm run question <QuestionNumber> <QuestionName>
```

So, for example, I just write:

```shell
npm run question 1 TwoSum
```
