# Notes

Need to revisit for a more optimal solution, but this was just an LC daily and
can be solved quickly in 0(n) using a single hash map to track the frequency of each
word (after converting both string to arrays). Then, iterating through the hash
and pushing and 1 frequency words to a result array.
