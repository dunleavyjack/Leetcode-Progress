# Notes: LC 2169 Count Operations To Obtain Zero

I used a pretty simple recursive solution for this one. I read about another
solution using `%` that doesn't require the same space complexity as the
recursive call-stack, which I'll explore another time.

| Time               | Space              |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| O(max(num1, num2)) | O(max(num1, num2)) |
