# Leetcode Progress

Just tracking my personal progress for Leetcode 🏄‍♂️🏄‍♂️.

Mostly in TypeScript, but also Kotlin, Go, Java, and a few others for fun.

My [Leetcode Account](https://leetcode.com/jack_joseph/) :)

Also, I wrote a shell script in here to generate files for each new question
that's been really helpful. It generates the folder, the TS file, as well
as the markdown file I write notes in. I only need to run:

```Shell
npm run question {{ Question Number }} {{ Question Name }}
```
