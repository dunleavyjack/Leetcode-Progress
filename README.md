## Generator for New Questions

To make life easier, I wrote a handy shell script that generates everything I
need to start solving a new problem. It creates:

- A folder for the problem
- A `.ts` file for the code
- A `.md` file for solution explanations and tips for future me

The command is:

```shell
npm run question <QuestionNumber> <QuestionName>
```

For example:

```shell
npm run question 1 TwoSum
```
